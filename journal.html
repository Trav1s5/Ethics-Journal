                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-slate-700">
                            <p>Today was my first ethics class. It was more of an introduction to ethics and a YouTube video which elaborated on reasoning according to Aristotle. At first, I did not know that reasoning was what comes about due to premises. Like I must see something over and over and over and over so that I can logically reason and produce a conclusion. Before this, I thought reasoning meant acting based on intuition to do what feels right. For instance, if someone offered me a cigarette, I would reason: “Smoking is bad for my lungs and addictive,” and decide not to smoke. I used to see reasoning as focusing only on the end result.</p>
                            <p>Something that resonated with me in today’s class was when Mrs. Sheila taught about the “spontaneous moral knowledge” about having moral sense about our own acts and how we act based on our conscience. In my opinion I agree with it since what one thinks most of the time, they end up becoming acts at one point. If a person let say thinks about food, they tend to buy food or if the envy someone’s shoes they may steal the shoe or buy the exact same shoe basically showing how our consciousness shifts our actions. Like last week for example I had been thinking of going swimming and after a couple of days I found myself swimming. That realization made this part of the class especially enjoyable for me.</p>

                    <!-- Entry 2: Voluntary Acts -->
                    <section id="entry-2" class="journal-entry bg-white p-6 md:p-8 rounded-xl shadow-md hidden">

                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-slate-700">
                           <p>The concept of the will is very interesting. Today I learnt about how intentional the will is - how our identity is shaped by our actions. “A thief is a thief since they have stolen” that type of concept. But may I have been a thief when I was small, I stole some money to pay a debt? It did not feel intentional since it was more of an imperfectly voluntary act due to the fact I was stressed. I also learnt about the types of voluntary where one person’s acts can be classified into four acts based on how he/she is influenced. On Friday we had an assignment that was completely forgotten and the lecturer wanted it by the end of the class. Some used AI all the way some left it as it is while others like me tried to do the most we can by the help of the resources we had though we didn’t finish we were doing this and after this class it felt more of a mixed act .Well all in all today taught me that perfectly voluntary acts which we do acts while fully aware and fully conscious is the best way of doing actions in our day to day life.</p>

                        <h3 class="entry-title text-2xl font-bold mt-1 mb-4 text-slate-900">Freedom</h3>
                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-slate-700">
                           <p>Since I was a kid I always wanted to go to university , not because I wanted to learn but because on paper it is everything a boy would want: I mean no curfews , driving cars , deciding when I want to go to school I mean heaven on earth really but in the real world it is way too complicated, to drive you have to go to driving to school ,not to have a curfew you have to have your own house where bills are due and to align my virtues to the moral laws based on what we are taught in class. Sadly, freedom isn’t about what I can do but about what I should do and many at times they don’t align. Like yesterday I choose to go to church not because I was forced but because it is my obligation as a Christian to go to church and honor God. In today’s class the lecturer said that true freedom isn’t the absence of rules, it’s the ability to choose what is good even when doing bad is a choice. As I start this week, I hope to know what true freedom feels like—not just the ability to do whatever I want, but the strength to choose what is morally good. Since whatever I do will shape my life in one way or another since my actions have consequences.</p>

                    <!-- Entry 4: Happiness -->
                    <section id="entry-4" class="journal-entry bg-white p-6 md:p-8 rounded-xl shadow-md hidden">
                        <h3 class="entry-title text-2xl font-bold mt-1 mb-4 text-slate-900">Happiness</h3>
                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-slate-700">
                           <p>In today’s class we learnt about happiness, human virtue and friendship. I’ll start with happiness; from today’s class I got to understand that the final goal of man is to be happy. Which led to my first question are we alive to be happy or are we supposed to make ourselves happy? This made me reflect on whether happiness is something we pursue or something we cultivate through virtue and intentional living. Is happiness handed to us by life’s circumstances, or is it earned through how we choose to act?</p>
                           <p>I also learnt about friendship and its various forms. Currently most friendships around young people my age are of utility and pleasure. Since they are only for a period when they want to experience a certain feeling of “fun”. It was also an eye opener since I understood that the end goal of friendships is for building friends till, we become the best version of ourselves thus if I had more philosophical friendships not only would I grow in stature, but I will be able to grow with others. Tho as Aristotle said it is not possible to have many philosophical friendships which led to my next question, is it worth having one friend of virtue for a long period of time, over 100 friends of pleasure and utility where you have fun and receive their usefulness but for a short period of time?</p>

                    <!-- Entry 5: Moral Principles -->
                    <section id="entry-5" class="journal-entry bg-white p-6 md:p-8 rounded-xl shadow-md hidden">
                        <h3 class="entry-title text-2xl font-bold mt-1 mb-4 text-slate-900">Moral Principles</h3>
                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-slate-700">
                           <p>Treating others the way you would like to be treated may have been my takeaway of a part of this entry topic. I do remember this one day when I met a friend of mine laughing at another friend of mine because of having scored a 3 in one of the cats it wasn’t in a bad way it is just that it was since he had gotten 1 more mark higher. I didn’t understand it at the time, but the act of laughing had really demoralized our friend, and it wasn’t done with the intention of harming him. So, once I learnt about this, I asked myself what if it were reversed how would he have felt? Maybe now I get to understand the gist of seeing the world in a different lens and not only my own since different people may see similar situations more important than others and if we may have known we may have offered some sources that would have helped our friend in passing the next exam.</p>
